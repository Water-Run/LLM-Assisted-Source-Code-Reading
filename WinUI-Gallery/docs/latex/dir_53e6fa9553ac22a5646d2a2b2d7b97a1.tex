The {\ttfamily scripts} folder contains a set of tools and utilities that are repeatedly used by developers to assist in managing and developing the Win\+UI Gallery. These tools streamline various development tasks, providing functionality to track, manage, and organize files within the repository.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Note}}\+: Before running any Power\+Shell script, you must set the execution policy to allow locally created scripts to run. Use the following command to set the policy\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Set-\/ExecutionPolicy\ RemoteSigned\ -\/Scope\ CurrentUser}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This ensures that Power\+Shell scripts downloaded from the internet are not run unless they are signed by a trusted publisher, while locally created scripts are allowed to run. \end{quote}
